# Fun Text ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The fun website ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
## What is this website?
This website is just here to cheer you up when you are bored. This website for can:
- Give you text faces to use with your friends;
- Make you look like an hacker in front of your friends;
- Give you random gifs from Giphy;
- Give you random memes from Reddit (I think it's the most useful service so far...).
And for now that's it, but I will try to add new functions every time I can
## Why is it called Fun Text?
Well... At start I wanted this to be a texting app, but then changed my mind because there are a lot of texting apps, and I wanted to do something different. Then I decided to make a fun website for bored people, and was to lazy to change the name... But I think it's good anyway.<br><br><strong>So, what are you still doing here? Keep on facing! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</strong>
