# Fun Text ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The fun website ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
## What is this website?
This website is just here to cheer you up when you are bored.
## Why is it called Fun Text?
Well... At start I wanted this to be a texting app, but then changed my mind because there are a lot of texting apps, and I wanted to do something different. Then I decided to make a fun website for bored people, and was to lazy to change the name... But I think it's good anyway.<br><br><strong>So, what are you still doing here? Keep on facing! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</strong>
